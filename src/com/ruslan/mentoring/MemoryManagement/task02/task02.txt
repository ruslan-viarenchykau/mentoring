Design and implement code that will introduce:

java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space. Create big objects continuously and make them stay in memory. Do not use arrays or collections.
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace. Load classes continuously and make them stay in memory.
java.lang.StackOverflowError. Do not use recursive methods.

Use the most appropriate JVM option for the early goal achievement. Heap structure should be: 3-Eden, 3-S0, 3-S1, 1m to thread stack.
Install MAT for eclipse. Review plugin features. Investigate leak suspects.
Use VisualVM to observe how change memory spaces. Notice GC curve.
