1. Run app. Observe how 'below zero' appears. Review the code and try to explain why it happens

It happens because there is no logic to prevent counter from decrement if it's value is 0.
So if decrementing logic will be invoked more often than incrementing it is possible to get -1 value.
Also provided implementation is bad because increment/decrement is non-atomic operations and sometimes if these
operations will be executed in parallel the threads will interfere and the value might be wrong
