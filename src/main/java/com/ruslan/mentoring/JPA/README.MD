Create models: Employee, EmployeeStatus, Address, Personal, Project, Unit

Take into account the following:
EmployeeStatus should be Enum type
Address should be embedded to Employee object
Relationship between Employee and EmployeePersonalInfo should be one-to-one
Relationship between Employee and Project should be many-to-many
Relationship between Unit and Employee should be one-to-many

Implement Service API which provides:
Create Employee / Unit / Project
Find employee / Unit / Project by id
Delete employee / Unit / Project by id
Update Employee / Unit / Project by id
Add Employee to Unit by id’s
Assign Employee for Project by id’s

Use Hibernate to store data (users, accounts) of web-application in a database.
